# enter2tab
VanillaJavascript: Try enter/return behave as tab on webpages if class enter2tab is set on element

Just include enter2tab.js using 
<script src="enter2tab.js"></script> in the <head></head> of your webpage and in all elements that you set the class 'enter2tab' to, the enter key will behave like a (improved) tab.
The improvement is simply to move the marker to the end while tab set it at the beginning or select all text.

Have a look at enter2tab.html for example.

Can be installed using npm.
npm i enter2tab

Hope you enjoy this little hack, save you a few hours of work and some sanity.

Best regards
